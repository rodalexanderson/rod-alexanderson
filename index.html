                    <p>
                        I spent over 12+ years working for great companies. I learned a lot about managing businesses and strategic thinking. After a while, I got tired of following other directions and wanted to see if "I had what it takes". 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        In this journey of entrepreneurship, I managed to put my experience into these projects. Some of them did not work out, as many things in life, but I managed to start successful startups. I soon realized that time management and efficiency were critical factors to success. 
                    </p><br> 
                    <p>
                        I searched for tools to increase our team's efficiency, but I never found one that was the right fit for what I needed. In most of them, I had to adapt my business to the technology. I had to do something. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This is where my journey as a developer started, and I knew I had to go out and help as many entrepeneurs I could!

                        SEO means Search Engine Optimization. In human terms, it means configuring your webpage and content for search engines like Google, Yahoo, or Firefox.  
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        Why? It's easy; search engines can't see images or understand your content if your webpage doesn't follow their guides. That's where Technical & On-page SEO comes in handy. I'll help you get your website ready for all Search Engines!
